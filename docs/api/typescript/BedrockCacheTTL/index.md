  | "1h"
  | string & {

Defined in: [src/models/bedrock.ts:144](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-typescript/blob/00e04880c30c5ce1f76e40c164d32ce52f7b6dca/strands-ts/src/models/bedrock.ts#L144)

TTL durations accepted by Bedrock for prompt-cache checkpoints.

Bedrock currently accepts `'5m'` (default) and `'1h'`. The `(string & {})` branch keeps autocomplete on the known values while letting callers pass any string forward — Bedrock validates the value server-side and rejects unsupported values with `ValidationException`, so this stays correct as AWS adds new TTL values without an SDK update.

Bedrock also requires checkpoint TTLs to be **non-increasing** across `toolConfig` → system → messages — setting a longer TTL on a later checkpoint than an earlier one will be rejected by the service.
