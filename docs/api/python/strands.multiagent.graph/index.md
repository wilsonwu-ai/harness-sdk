Directed Graph Multi-Agent Pattern Implementation.

This module provides a deterministic graph-based agent orchestration system where agents or MultiAgentBase instances (like Swarm or Graph) are nodes in a graph, executed according to edge dependencies, with output from one node passed as input to connected nodes.

Key Features:

-   Agents and MultiAgentBase instances (Swarm, Graph, etc.) as graph nodes
-   Deterministic execution based on dependency resolution
-   Output propagation along edges
-   Support for cyclic graphs (feedback loops)
-   Clear dependency management
-   Supports nested graphs (Graph as a node in another Graph)

## GraphState

```python
@dataclass
class GraphState()
```

Defined in: [src/strands/multiagent/graph.py:66](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python/blob/main/strands-py/src/strands/multiagent/graph.py#L66)

Graph execution state.

**Attributes**:

-   `status` - Current execution status of the graph.
-   `completed_nodes` - Set of nodes that have completed execution.
-   `failed_nodes` - Set of nodes that failed during execution.
-   `interrupted_nodes` - Set of nodes that user interrupted during execution.
-   `execution_order` - List of nodes in the order they were executed.
-   `task` - The original input prompt/query provided to the graph execution. This represents the actual work to be performed by the graph as a whole. Entry point nodes receive this task as their input if they have no dependencies.
-   `start_time` - Timestamp when the current invocation started. Resets on each invocation, even when resuming from interrupt.
-   `execution_time` - Execution time of current invocation in milliseconds. Excludes time spent waiting for interrupt responses.

-   `invocation_state` - Additional state/context passed to underlying agents. Defaults to None to avoid mutable default argument issues.
-   `**kwargs` - Keyword arguments allowing backward compatible future changes.

                       **kwargs: Any) -> AsyncIterator[dict[str, Any]]
```

**Arguments**:

-   `task` - The task to execute
-   `invocation_state` - Additional state/context passed to underlying agents. Defaults to None to avoid mutable default argument issues.
-   `**kwargs` - Keyword arguments allowing backward compatible future changes.

Defined in: [src/strands/multiagent/graph.py:1212](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python/blob/main/strands-py/src/strands/multiagent/graph.py#L1212)

Restore graph state from a session dict and prepare for execution.

This method handles two scenarios:

1.  If the graph execution ended (no next\_nodes\_to\_execute, eg: Completed, or Failed with dead end nodes), resets all nodes and graph state to allow re-execution from the beginning.
2.  If the graph execution was interrupted mid-execution (has next\_nodes\_to\_execute), restores the persisted state and prepares to resume execution from the next ready nodes.

**Arguments**:

-   `payload` - Dictionary containing persisted state data including status, completed nodes, results, and next nodes to execute.
