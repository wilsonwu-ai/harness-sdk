Swarm Multi-Agent Pattern Implementation.

This module provides a collaborative agent orchestration system where agents work together as a team to solve complex tasks, with shared context and autonomous coordination.

Key Features:

-   Self-organizing agent teams with shared working memory
-   Tool-based coordination
-   Autonomous agent collaboration without central control
-   Dynamic task distribution based on agent capabilities
-   Collective intelligence through shared context
-   Human input via user interrupts raised in BeforeNodeCallEvent hooks and agent nodes

## SwarmNode

             event_type: type | list[type] | None = None,
             *,
             order: float = HookOrder.DEFAULT) -> None

Defined in: [src/strands/multiagent/swarm.py:318](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python/blob/main/strands-py/src/strands/multiagent/swarm.py#L318)

Register a hook callback with the swarm.

**Arguments**:

-   `callback` - The callback function to invoke when events of this type occur.
-   `event_type` - The class type(s) of events this callback should handle. Can be a single type, a list of types, or None to infer from the callback’s first parameter type hint.
-   `order` - Execution priority. Lower values execute first.

#### \_\_call\_\_

```python
def __call__(task: MultiAgentInput,
             invocation_state: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
             **kwargs: Any) -> SwarmResult
```

Defined in: [src/strands/multiagent/swarm.py:332](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python/blob/main/strands-py/src/strands/multiagent/swarm.py#L332)

Invoke the swarm synchronously.

**Arguments**:

-   `task` - The task to execute
-   `invocation_state` - Additional state/context passed to underlying agents. Defaults to None to avoid mutable default argument issues.
-   `**kwargs` - Keyword arguments allowing backward compatible future changes.

#### invoke\_async

```python
async def invoke_async(task: MultiAgentInput,
                       invocation_state: dict[str, Any] | None = None,

Invoke the swarm asynchronously.

This method uses stream\_async internally and consumes all events until completion, following the same pattern as the Agent class.

**Arguments**:

-   `task` - The task to execute
-   `invocation_state` - Additional state/context passed to underlying agents. Defaults to None to avoid mutable default argument issues.
-   `**kwargs` - Keyword arguments allowing backward compatible future changes.

async def stream_async(task: MultiAgentInput,
                       invocation_state: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
                       **kwargs: Any) -> AsyncIterator[dict[str, Any]]
```

Defined in: [src/strands/multiagent/swarm.py:371](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python/blob/main/strands-py/src/strands/multiagent/swarm.py#L371)

Stream events during swarm execution.

**Arguments**:

-   `task` - The task to execute
-   `invocation_state` - Additional state/context passed to underlying agents. Defaults to None to avoid mutable default argument issues.
-   `**kwargs` - Keyword arguments allowing backward compatible future changes.

**Yields**:

Dictionary events during swarm execution, such as:

-   multi\_agent\_node\_start: When a node begins execution
-   multi\_agent\_node\_stream: Forwarded agent events with node context
-   multi\_agent\_handoff: When control is handed off between agents
-   multi\_agent\_node\_stop: When a node stops execution
-   result: Final swarm result

#### serialize\_state

```python
def serialize_state() -> dict[str, Any]
```

Defined in: [src/strands/multiagent/swarm.py:976](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python/blob/main/strands-py/src/strands/multiagent/swarm.py#L976)

Serialize the current swarm state to a dictionary.

#### deserialize\_state

```python
def deserialize_state(payload: dict[str, Any]) -> None
```

Defined in: [src/strands/multiagent/swarm.py:1006](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python/blob/main/strands-py/src/strands/multiagent/swarm.py#L1006)

Restore swarm state from a session dict and prepare for execution.

This method handles two scenarios:

1.  If the persisted status is COMPLETED, FAILED resets all nodes and graph state to allow re-execution from the beginning.
2.  Otherwise, restores the persisted state and prepares to resume execution from the next ready nodes.

**Arguments**:

-   `payload` - Dictionary containing persisted state data including status, completed nodes, results, and next nodes to execute.
